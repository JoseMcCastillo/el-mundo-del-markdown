# Hi, I'm **José Castillo**,

#  Markdown table with at least 5 Terminal commands and their descriptions:
| **Commands** | **Description** |
|:------------:|:---------------:|
| ls | Lists the files and directories in the current directory.|
| cd | Changes the current directory to another specified directory.|
| mkdir | Creates a new directory in the current directory or in another specified directory.|
| rm | Deletes files and directories.|
| cp | Copies files and directories from one place to another.|

# Commands Alias Tools
An alias is an alternate name for a command. You can create your own aliases to make frequently used commands shorter and easier to remember. Here are some examples:
| Alias   | original command | Description                  |
|:-------:|:----------------:|:---------------------------: |
| ll      | ls -la           | Lists all files and directories, including hidden files, and shows additional information such as permissions and owners.|
| c       | clear            | Clear the terminal screen.   |

To create these aliases, you can add the following lines to your file **.bashrc** o **.bash_profile** *(dependiendo de tu sistema)*:
* alias ll='ls -la'
* alias c='clear

Once you've added these lines, you can use **ll** instead of **ls -la** and **c** instead of **clear**. You can create as many aliases as you need to make your work in the terminal more efficient and productive.
